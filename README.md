# Assignment5
## Sriya Reddy 

For this assignment, we were required to find the inverse and the determinant of two matrices A and B. 
The given matrices were loaded using the following code:
```
> A = matrix(1:100, nrow=10)
> B = matrix(1:1000, nrow=10)
```
Viewing the matrices, we get:
```
> View(A)
> View(B)
```
